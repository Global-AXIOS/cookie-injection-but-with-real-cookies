# cookie-injection-but-with-real-cookies

This was a Hack CU V project completed by myself and [Fisher
Darling](https://github.com/fisherdarling). The goal of this project
is to teach children from the 3rd to 6th grade about what it means to
think in the cybersecurity mindset. It uses the idea of the
player(client) delivering a payload (a cookie) to the server (a cookie
monster). The player has to use cybersecurity concepts like analyzing
the enviorment, Man in the middle attacks, etc to figure out how to
pass the cookie monster.

## Techincal details

The code, as well as executables, can be downloaded from the [release
page](https://github.com/jakevossen5/cookie-injection-but-with-real-cookies/releases), which is the state of the code when the hackathon was
completed. Read the whitepaper pdf attached to learn more about the
future development plans and a release proposal.
