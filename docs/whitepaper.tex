\title{Cookie Injection but with Real Cookies}
\author{Jake Vossen, Fisher Darling}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  
\textit{Cookie Injection but with Real Cookies} is a
game designed to teach the basics of web explotation to 3rd through
6th grades through the analogy of actual cookies. The game is broken
down into several \textbf{stages}, each teaching a important lesson in
cybersecurity. While primarily cookie-based vulnerabilities are
explored, MITM attacks, encryption, SQL/templete injection and other
security explotations. At each stage, the player must bake a cookie
that is pleasing to the \textbf{cookie monster}. In this senario, the
player repersents a computer client, while the cookie monster plays
the role an authentication server. Upon propper presentation of a
cookie, the player can move on to the next stage. Additionally, at
every stage, there is a link to real world examples and applicable
additional information.

\section{Stages}

The \textbf{difficulty} defines at what approximate age will the stage
be trivial. This is not at all the minimum age to be able to acomplish
the level with understanding, a much younger child will be able to do
this, just less trivially. These are also our best estimates, not a
scientific analysis of difficulty.

Each stage has an \textbf{learning objective}, which is the goal that
the level is trying to teach. The objective is cybersecurity concept /
idea that the player should obtain after completing the level.

Additionally, each stage has a \textbf{learning significance},
explaining why the concept taught is important in the world of
security. While sometimes these will feel far fetched from the basic
actions preformed by the user, the important part is giving the player
some concpet (even if it is subconcious) about the important security
issues facing the web today.

\subsection{Stage 1: Introduciton | Difficulty: 3rd Grade}

Stage one is the most basic of stages. The player simply goes up to
the cookie monster, who then diplays a messeage requesting a chocolate
chip cookie. The player has to go to the oven and make a simple
chocolate chip cookie, which he can give to the cookie monster to pass
through the stage.

\subsubsection{Learning Objective}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Introduce the player to the dialog, controls, and playstyle of
the game
  \item Provide an example of a successful stage
  \item Provide an example of a situation where you are sucessfully
loging into a website with no web exploitation used.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learining Significance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce the idea of the client server model
  \item Introduce the idea of payloads from the client to the server,
    and the server preforming actions based of that request
  \item Introduce the idea of what an API call is
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stage 2: Fakeout | Difficulty: 3rd Grade}

This stage introduces the idea of not using cookies. When the player
walks up to the cookie monster, he claims that he is the biggest
snickerdoodle fan in the world, and he wants you to give him a
snickerdoodle. He gives you instructions on how to make a
snickerdoodle. However, behind and around the cookie monster there are
signs proclaiming his love for oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookie
monster only lets you pass if you give him a oatmeal raisin cookie,
and will reject your cookie if you give him a snickerdoodle.
