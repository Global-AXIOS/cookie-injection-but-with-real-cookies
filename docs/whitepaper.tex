\begin{abstract}
\textit{Cookie Injection but with Real Cookies} is a game designed to
teach the basics of web explotation to 3rd through 6th grades through
the analogy of actual cookies. The game is broken down into several
\textbf{stages}, each teaching a important lesson in
cybersecurity. While primarily cookie-based vulnerabilities are
explored, MITM attacks, encryption, SQL/templete injection and other
security explotations. At each stage, the player must bake a cookie
that is pleasing to the \textbf{cookie monster}. In this senario, the
player repersents a computer client, while the cookie monster plays
the role an authentication server. Upon propper presentation of a
cookie, the player can move on to the next stage. Additionally, at
every stage, there is a link to real world examples and applicable
additional information.
