\title{Cookie Injection but with Real Cookies}
\author{Jake Vossen, Fisher Darling}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  
\textit{Cookie Injection but with Real Cookies} is a game designed to
teach the basics of web explotation to $3^{rd}$ through $6^{th}$
grades through the analogy of actual cookies. The game is broken down
into several \textbf{stages}, each teaching a important lesson in
cybersecurity. This allows us to explore cookie injection, MITM
attacks, encryption, SQL/templete injection and other security
explotations. At each stage, the player must bake a cookie that is
pleasing to the \textbf{cookie monster}. In this senario, the player
repersents a computer client, while the cookie monster plays the role
an authentication server. Upon propper presentation of a cookie, the
player can move on to the next stage. All external assets and code is

engine.

\section{Inspiration}

Our goal is to teach children from about the $3^{rd}$ grade to
$7^{th}$ grade about critical thinking skills involved in the cybersecurity
field. While some of the concepts are (hopefully) not prevelent in
production today, teach the same type of problem solving mindset that
needs to be taught. By using cookies analogously with HTTP requests,
we can learn about many concepts that will be handy as the player
progresses to CTFs and hopefully to a larger carrier in the cyber
industry. 

\section{Stages}

The \textbf{difficulty} defines at what approximate age will the stage
be trivial. This is not at all the minimum age to be able to acomplish
the level with understanding, a much younger child will be able to do
this, just less trivially. These are also our best estimates, not a
scientific analysis of difficulty.

Each stage has an \textbf{learning objective}, which is the goal that
the level is trying to teach. The objective is cybersecurity concept /
idea that the player should obtain after completing the level.

Additionally, each stage has a \textbf{learning significance},
explaining why the concept taught is important in the world of
security. While sometimes these will feel far fetched from the basic
actions preformed by the user, the important part is giving the player
some concpet (even if it is subconcious) about the important security
issues facing the web today.

\subsection{Stage 1: Introduciton | Difficulty: Third Grade}

Stage one is the most basic of stages. The player simply goes up to
the cookie monster, who then diplays a messeage requesting a chocolate
chip cookie. The player has to go to the oven and make a simple
chocolate chip cookie, which he can give to the cookie monster to pass
through the stage.

\subsubsection{Learning Objective}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Introduce the player to the dialog, controls, and playstyle of
the game
  \item Provide an example of a successful stage
  \item Provide an example of a situation where you are sucessfully
loging into a website with no web exploitation used.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learining Significance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce the idea of the client server model
  \item Introduce the idea of payloads from the client to the server,
    and the server preforming actions based of that request
  \item Introduce the idea of what an API call is
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stage 2: Fakeout | Difficulty: Third Grade}

This stage introduces the idea of not using cookies as instructed. When the player
walks up to the cookie monster, he claims that he is the biggest
penutbutter cookie fan in the world, and he wants you to give him a
penutbutter cookie. He gives you instructions on how to make a
peanutbutter cookie. However, behind and around the cookie monster there are
signs proclaiming his love for oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookie
monster only lets you pass if you give him a oatmeal raisin cookie,
and will reject your cookie if you give him a peanutbetter cookie. 

\subsubsection{Learning Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Web exploitations often include disobeying instructions given
    to the website
  \item The client cannot be trusted to provide 'safe' input
  \item Basic \textit{admin = true} type exploitation on simple sites
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learning Signficance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Almost every exploit comes from a user not obeying the
    instructions of the server
  \item Websites that use cookies have to be incredible careful with
    how they encode / encrypt the data
  \item This is a similar setup to SQL injection, a classic example of
    web exploitation
\end{itemize}
